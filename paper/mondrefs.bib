	abstract = {We present mass models of the Milky Way created to fit observational constraints and to be consistent with expectations from theoretical modelling. The method used to create these models is that demonstrated in {McMillan} (2011), and we improve on those models by adding gas discs to the potential, considering the effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile to vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the Milky Way amongst the new constraints. We provide a best fitting model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is \$R\_0 = (8.20{\textbackslash}pm0.09){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ from the Galactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being \$v\_0 = (232.8{\textbackslash}pm3.0){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$; that the Galaxy has a total stellar mass of \$(54.3{\textbackslash}pm5.7){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, a total virial mass of \$(1.30 {\textbackslash}pm 0.30){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a local dark-matter density of \$0.38{\textbackslash}pm0.04{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{GeV}{\textbackslash},cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on \$R\_0\$, we find it to be \$(7.97{\textbackslash}pm0.15){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ and that \$v\_0=(226.8{\textbackslash}pm4.2){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We find that most of these properties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive to the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo. We find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs significantly from that found under assumptions of axisymmetry. We have made code to compute the force from our potential, and to integrate orbits within it, publicly available.},

We stress the crucial role of stellar survey selection functions in any such modeling; and we advocate the utility of viewing the Galactic stellar disk as made up from `mono-abundance populations' ({MAPs}), both for dynamical modeling and for constraining the Milky Way's evolutionary processes. We review recent work on the spatial and kinematical distribution of {MAPs}, and lay out how further study of {MAPs} in the Gaia era should lead to a decisively clearer picture of the Milky Way's dark matter distribution and formation history.},

	abstract = {A unique signature of the modified Newtonian dynamics ({MOND}) paradigm is its peculiar behavior in the vicinity of the points where the total Newtonian acceleration exactly cancels. In the Solar System, these are the saddle points of the gravitational potential near the planets. Typically, such points are embedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la {MOND} predict significant deviations from Newton's laws. As has been pointed out recently, the Earth-Sun bubble may be visited by the {LISA} Pathfinder spacecraft in the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to a direct test. In this work, we present a high-precision model of the Solar System's gravitational potential to determine accurate positions and motions of these saddle points and study the predicted dynamical anomalies within the framework of quasi-linear {MOND}. Considering the expected sensitivity of the {LISA} Pathfinder probe, we argue that interpolation functions which exhibit a "faster" transition between the two dynamical regimes have a good chance of surviving a null result. An example of such a function is the {QMOND} analog of the so-called simple interpolating function which agrees well with much of the extragalactic phenomenology. We have also discovered that several of Saturn's outermost satellites periodically intersect the Saturn-Sun bubble, providing the first example of Solar System objects that regularly undergo the {MOND} regime.},

This method preserves the property that the time evolution of such a system yields a canonical transformation from the initial conditions to the final state. That is, the integration step is an explicit symplectic map. Although the result is first derived for a specific type of Hamiltonian, it is shown to be quite general. In particular, the results can be applied to any Lie group.},

	abstract = {The rotation curve ({RC}) of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is constructed starting from its very inner regions (few hundred parsecs) out to a large galactocentric distance of ‚àº200 kpc using kinematical data on a variety of tracer objects moving in the gravitational potential of the Galaxy, without assuming any theoretical models of the visible and dark matter ({DM}) components of the Galaxy. We study the effect on the {RC} due to the uncertainties in the values of the Galactic constants ({GCs}) R0 and V0 (these being the Sun's distance from and circular rotation speed around the Galactic center, respectively) and the velocity anisotropy parameter Œ≤ of the halo tracer objects used for deriving the {RC} at large galactocentric distances. The resulting {RC} in the disk region is found to depend significantly on the choice of the {GCs}, while the dominant uncertainty in the {RC} at large distances beyond the stellar disk comes from the uncertainty in the value of Œ≤. In general we find that the mean {RC} steadily declines at distances beyond ‚àº60 kpc, independently of the value of Œ≤. Also, at a given radius, the circular speed is lower for larger values of Œ≤ (i.e., for more radially biased velocity anisotropy). Considering that the largest possible value of Œ≤ is unity, which corresponds to stellar orbits being purely radial, our results for the case of Œ≤ = 1 give a lower limit to the total mass of the Galaxy within ‚àº200 kpc, M(200 kpc) ‚â≥ (6.8 ¬± 4.1) √ó 1011 M‚òâ, independently of any model of the {DM} halo of the Galaxy.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, a consensus picture has emerged in which roughly a quarter of the universe consists of dark matter. I begin with a review of the observational evidence for the existence of dark matter: rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lensing measurements, hot gas in clusters, galaxy formation, primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background observations. Then I discuss a number of anomalous signals in a variety of data sets that may point to discovery, though all of them are controversial. The annual modulation in the {DAMA} detector and/or the gamma-ray excess seen in the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope from the Galactic Center could be due to {WIMPs}; a 3.5 {keV} X-ray line from multiple sources could be due to sterile neutrinos; or the 511 {keV} line in {INTEGRAL} data could be due to {MeV} dark matter. All of these would require further confirmation in other experiments or data sets to be proven correct. In addition, a new line of research on dark stars is presented, which suggests that the first stars to exist in the universe were powered by dark matter heating rather than by fusion: the observational possibility of discovering dark matter in this way is discussed.},

	abstract = {A new formulation of {MOND} as a modified-potential theory of gravity is propounded. In effect, the theory dictates that the {MOND} potential phi produced by a mass distribution rho is a solution of the Poisson equation for the modified source density rho*=-(1/4 pi G)divergence(g), where g=nu({\textbar}{gN}{\textbar}/a0){gN}, and {gN} is the Newtonian acceleration field of rho. This makes phi simply the scalar potential of the algebraic acceleration field g. The theory thus involves solving only linear differential equations, with one nonlinear, algebraic step. It is derivable from an action, satisfies all the usual conservation laws, and gives the correct center-of-mass acceleration to composite bodies. The theory is akin in some respects to the nonlinear Poisson formulation of Bekenstein and Milgrom, but it is different from it, and is obviously easier to apply. The two theories are shown to emerge as natural modifications of a Palatini-type formulation of Newtonian gravity, and are members in a larger class of bi-potential theories.},
